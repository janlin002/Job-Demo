base vs components vs utilities 差異

```
- The base layer is for things like reset rules or default styles applied to plain HTML elements.
- The components layer is for class-based styles that you want to be able to override with utilities.
- The utilities layer is for small, single-purpose classes that should always take precedence over any other styles.
```
