### what is Component?
reusable UI elements for your app

componentの概念: compose(組成) & reuse(重用)

A React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup

React 組件是一個 JavaScript 函數，您可以在其中添加標記


Notice the difference in casing:

- <section> is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
- <Profile /> starts with a capital P, so React knows that we want to use our component called Profile.

In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.

React components are regular JavaScript functions except:
- Their names always begin with a capital letter.
- They return JSX markup.
